This repository provides a complete, modular workflow designed to integrate quantum chemistry with modern machine learning techniques to accelerate research in materials science and computational chemistry. The pipeline covers the entire process from high-throughput virtual library construction and representative sampling, to sophisticated feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and finally to the construction, evaluation, interpretation, and application of a high-performance stacking ensemble model.

## 📂 Repository Structure and Workflow

This repository contains two core research projects, each utilizing the complete code workflow. The `CPyr/` directory holds the main body of work, focusing on the **dichloropyrimidine** molecular system as additives in `Li-S batteries`, which is the primary subject of this README. The `1,4-Benzoquinone/` directory contains a secondary application of the same workflow to the **1,4-Benzoquinone** system as additives in `Li-CO2 batteries`, serving as another example to validate the universality of this machine learning workflow and molecular skeleton design paradigm.

1.  **Feature Engineering (Script 2)**:
    * Use `Original dataset.xlsx` as input.
    * You need to run `Feature Engineering.ipynb` **twice**:
        * First run: Set the target variable to the `Gap` column to generate `Gap-final dataset.xlsx`.
        * Second run: Set the target variable to the `Barrier` column to generate `Barrier-final dataset.xlsx`.
2.  **Model Training & Prediction (Scripts 3, 4, 5)**:

    * Executes an advanced hybrid sampling strategy to select a manageable and highly representative subset for subsequent DFT calculations.
    * Provides UMAP dimensionality reduction for intuitive visualization of the sampling coverage and uniformity.

* **▶️ Usage**:
    1.  Configure the core molecular structure parameters in the `User Configuration` section.
    2.  Run the script to generate Excel files and a UMAP visualization plot.

* **⚙️ Tunable Parameters**:
    * `NUM_SITES`: **(Required)** The total number of substitutable sites on the molecular scaffold.
    * `NUM_FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS`: **(Required)** The total number of available functional groups or building blocks.
    * `SYMMETRY_STRING`: **(Key)** Defines site symmetry. The format is flexible, e.g., `"1,3"` means sites 1 and 3 are equivalent; `"1,4; 2,3"` means 1 is equivalent to 4, AND 2 is equivalent to 3. Leave empty for no symmetry.
    * `SAMPLE_FRACTION`: The proportion of the total library to sample (a value between 0.0 and 1.0), e.g., `0.1` for 10%.
    * `RANDOM_SEED`: A random seed to ensure the reproducibility of sampling and visualization.

* **📄 Outputs**:
    * **Console Output**: Prints configuration details, the total number of unique molecules generated, statistics for each molecular pattern, and sampling targets.

    * **UMAP Visualization Plot**: An interactive plot window showing the distribution of sampled points (red) within the entire chemical space (gray).
    * **📝 Output File Format Explanation**:
        * The generated molecule is represented by a string of Arabic numerals (e.g., `"216"`).
        * The **position** of a numeral corresponds to the **site** on the scaffold (e.g., the first digit is for site 1, the second for site 2, etc.).
        * The **numeral itself** represents the functional group at that site. The mapping varies by project:
            * For the primary **Dichloropyrimidine** project (`CPyr/`):
                * * `1` to `6` correspond to `-H`, `-Me`, `-Et`, `-NH2`, `-OCH3`, `-CF3`, `-CN`.
            * For the secondary **1,4-Benzoquinone** project:
                * `1` to `6` correspond to `-F`, `-Cl`, `-H`, `-Me`, `-OCH3`, `-NH2`.
        * **Example (Dichloropyrimidine)**: A molecule represented as `"216"` means Site 1 is substituted with `-Me`, Site 2 with `-H`, and Site 3 with `-CF3`.

## 💻 How to Use

1.  **Environment Setup**:
    Download the scripts and `requirements.txt` file from the desired project folder (e.g., `CPyr/`). Install all dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Workflow Execution**:
    * **Step 1: Generate Molecular Library**
        * Run `Molecule Generation & Sampling.ipynb` to produce a list of representative molecules (`representative_sample.xlsx`).
        * Perform your own quantum chemistry calculations on this library and compile the results with feature descriptors into a new master Excel file.

    * **Step 2: Engineer Features**
        * Run `Feature Engineering.ipynb` on your master Excel file to generate the optimal feature set (`final_selected_dataset_...xlsx`).

    * **Step 3: Train and Predict**
        * Open and run the cells in `Tree_stacking.ipynb` sequentially. This notebook performs:
            * **Hyperparameter Optimization** (Script 3) on the feature-engineered data.
            * **Stacking Ensemble Evaluation** (Script 4) to build and validate the final model.
            * **Prediction** (Script 5) on new, unseen data.

    ⚠️ **Important Note**: Scripts 3, 4, and 5 are located within `Tree_stacking.ipynb` and must be run in the same session to pass variables (like optimized models) in memory.
