## 📂 Repository Structure and Workflow

This repository contains two core research projects, each utilizing the complete code workflow. The `CPyr/` directory holds the main body of work, focusing on the **2-chloropyrimidine** molecular system as additives in `Li-S batteries`, which is the primary subject of this README. The `1,4-Benzoquinone/` directory contains a secondary application of the same workflow to the **1,4-Benzoquinone** system as additives in `Li-CO2 batteries`, serving as another example to validate the universality of this machine learning workflow and molecular skeleton design paradigm.

    * Generates all possible molecular combinations based on user-defined substitutable sites and functional groups.
    * Automatically identifies and eliminates duplicate structures using symmetry rules, ensuring a unique molecular library.
    * Executes an advanced hybrid sampling strategy to select a manageable and highly representative subset for subsequent DFT calculations.
    * Provides UMAP dimensionality reduction for intuitive visualization of the sampling coverage and uniformity.

* **▶️ Usage**:
    1.  Configure the core molecular structure parameters in the `User Configuration` section.
    2.  Run the script to generate Excel files and a UMAP visualization plot.

* **⚙️ Tunable Parameters**:
    * `NUM_SITES`: **(Required)** The total number of substitutable sites on the molecular scaffold.
    * `NUM_FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS`: **(Required)** The total number of available functional groups or building blocks.
    * `SYMMETRY_STRING`: **(Key)** Defines site symmetry. The format is flexible, e.g., `"1,3"` means sites 1 and 3 are equivalent; `"1,4; 2,3"` means 1 is equivalent to 4, AND 2 is equivalent to 3. Leave empty for no symmetry.
    * `SAMPLE_FRACTION`: The proportion of the total library to sample (a value between 0.0 and 1.0), e.g., `0.1` for 10%.
    * `RANDOM_SEED`: A random seed to ensure the reproducibility of sampling and visualization.

* **📄 Outputs**:
    * **Console Output**: Prints configuration details, the total number of unique molecules generated, statistics for each molecular pattern, and sampling targets.

    * `representative_sample.xlsx`: The representative subset of molecules selected by the hybrid sampling strategy.
    * **UMAP Visualization Plot**: An interactive plot window showing the distribution of sampled points (red) within the entire chemical space (gray).
    * **📝 Output File Format Explanation**:
        * The generated molecule is represented by a string of Arabic numerals (e.g., `"216"`).
        * The **position** of a numeral corresponds to the **site** on the scaffold (e.g., the first digit is for site 1, the second for site 2, etc.).
        * The **numeral itself** represents the functional group at that site. The mapping varies by project:
            * For the primary **2-chloropyrimidine** project (`CPyr/`):
                * `1` to `7` correspond to `-H`, `-Me`, `-Et`, `-NH2`, `-OCH3`, `-CF3`, `-CN`.
            * For the secondary **1,4-Benzoquinone** project:
                * `1` to `6` correspond to `-F`, `-Cl`, `-H`, `-Me`, `-OCH3`, `-NH2`.
        * **Example (2-chloropyrimidine)**: A molecule represented as `"216"` means Site 1 is substituted with `-Me`, Site 2 with `-H`, and Site 3 with `-CF3`.

* **💡 Highlights**:
    * **Canonicalization for Deduplication**: Accurately removes duplicate structures by calculating a molecule's "canonical form."
    * **Hybrid Sampling Strategy**: Strictly pursues component balance, achieving an optimal trade-off between diversity and representativeness.

    Download the scripts and `requirements.txt` file from the desired project folder (e.g., `CPyr/`). Install all dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Workflow Execution**:
    * **Step 1: Generate Molecular Library**
        * Run `Molecule Generation & Sampling.ipynb` to produce a list of representative molecules (`representative_sample.xlsx`).
        * Perform your own quantum chemistry calculations on this library and compile the results with feature descriptors into a new master Excel file.

    * **Step 2: Engineer Features**

## 📦 Environment Setup & Reproducibility

This section outlines the necessary dependencies and provides three distinct methods for environment setup. Please choose the one that best suits your needs.

### 🐍 Python Version

This project was developed and tested using **Python 3.10.18**. While it may work with other Python 3.10+ versions, using this specific version is recommended to maximize reproducibility. The configuration files provided in the options below will automatically install the correct Python version when using Conda.

---

### 📋 Core Dependencies

```
# Core scientific computing and machine learning libraries
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.22.4

### Environment Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:** For academic review or users who need to reproduce the results from our paper as closely as possible, **it is highly recommended to use Option 1**. Using Option 2 or 3 is more likely to produce numerical differences in the output, even with identical code and random seeds. This is primarily due to the following reasons:

1.  **Dependency Solver Ambiguity** 🧩: `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` files allow the dependency solver (Conda or Pip) to select different versions of underlying sub-dependencies over time.
2.  **Platform-Specific Builds** 💻: Even with identical package versions, the underlying compiled libraries (e.g., Intel MKL vs. OpenBLAS) can differ across operating systems, causing minute variations in floating-point calculations.
3.  **Sensitivity of Stochastic Optimization** 🎲: This project utilizes Bayesian Optimization. The minor computational variations from the points above can influence the optimization trajectory, leading to different hyperparameter choices and, consequently, different final results.
4.  **Stochasticity from Parallel Computing** ⚡: To accelerate computations, the script may utilize parallel processing (e.g., via `n_jobs=-1`). However, when computations are executed across multiple CPU cores, the precise order of floating-point operations can vary slightly, which can be amplified by iterative algorithms.

---

### 🥇 Option 1: Highest-Fidelity Reproducibility (via `spec-file.txt`)

This method is the most robust approach to maximize the likelihood of reproducing the numerical results. It uses an explicit specification file that locks the exact version, build, and source URL of every software package.

**Platform:** This method is strictly platform-dependent. The provided `spec-file.txt` is for **Windows (x64)** only.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.
2. Download the `spec-file.txt` file from this repository.
3. Execute the following command in your terminal (Anaconda Prompt) to create the environment:
    ```bash
    conda create --name my-project-env --file spec-file.txt
    ```
4. Activate the newly created environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate my-project-env
    ```

---

### 🥈 Option 2: Cross-Platform Setup (via `environment.yml`)

This method is recommended for general users who wish to run the code on different operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS). It uses the `environment.yml` file to create a functionally equivalent environment but may produce minor numerical differences from the original results.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.
2. Download the `environment.yml` file from this repository.
3. Execute the following command to create the environment:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml -n my-project-env
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate my-project-env
    ```

---

### 🥉 Option 3: Basic Setup (via `requirements.txt`)

This option is provided for users who prefer to work with standard Python virtual environments (`venv`) and `pip`. This method also does not ensure exact numerical reproducibility.

**Instructions:**
1. It is recommended to first create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows, activate with:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Linux/macOS, activate with:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Download the `requirements.txt` file from this repository.
3. Run the following command to install all dependencies (including Jupyter for running notebooks):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt jupyterlab
    ```
